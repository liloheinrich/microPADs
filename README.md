# Image Analysis of Colorimetric pH Test

Paper Panacea: Part Pandemic Final Project, Spring 2021

Team members: Kelly Yen, Lilo Heinrich

Proof-of-concept for using smartphones to take images and analyze the test results of colorimetric microfluidic paper-based analytical devices (microPADs). Our goal is to read the test value with at least the same precision as the human eye.
